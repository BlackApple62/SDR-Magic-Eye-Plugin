# SDRSharp Magic-Eye Plugin

The files in this zip archive will add an old-style "Magic Eye", or else "Cat's Eye" to SDR# software (www.airspy.com). Please follow the instructions in the text file MagicLine.txt It is compiled as 32bit platform, with .NET Framework version 4.6. Will not run on SDR# versions older than r1362 (14 Sept 2015)

The Plug-in is written in a clean programming style and is guaranteed to be virus/trojan/malware free. This plugin is donated for free to the huge SDR# users community. As such, I assume no responsibility for any problems the use of this plugin may cause. You are invited for constructive comments and suggestions. Any reasonable request might be fulfilled based on my spare time, be patient...
